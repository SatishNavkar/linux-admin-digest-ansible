In order for Hashicorp Vault to manage (rotate) the password for a service account,
the service account needs to be under the Hashicorp Vault OU and
manually added to the HashicorpVault-AD secrets under the relevant namespace.

New service account can directly be requested under the Hashicorp Vault OU or existing accounts can be migrated over.
